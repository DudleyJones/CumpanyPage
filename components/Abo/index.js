            <h3>Couch-Cleaning Company</h3>
            <p>
              We offer professional in-home cleaning services, because today
              furnishing and floor coverings have become indispensable elements
              of our everyday life, creating comfort and stylizing the space
              around us. These items become the first sources of dust and dirt
              accumulation, causing unpleasant odors, dull and aged appearance
              of items and reproduction of pathogenic organisms.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pile structure of such coverings makes them difficult to
              clean. A simple brush or vacuum cleaner will only remove dirt from
              the surface, while the pathogenic microorganisms that have formed
              inside will continue to actively develop. In addition, some
              coverings require careful cleaning and household items such as a
              brush can damage the delicate surface of an expensive sofa or
              carpet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Specializing in modern cleaning, Couch-Cleaning Company provides
              steam-cleaning services in New York. We eliminate stubborn stains,
              remove deposits of dust and dirt that are invisible to the eye and
              neutralize unpleasant odors. Developing in the field of cleaning
              for years, the company has formed a productive concept of
              cleaning:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Certified and safe products for effective stain and dirt
                removal.
              </li>
              <li>Expensive and innovative equipment.</li>
              <li>The use of advanced American technology.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Such a process has no negative impact on the human body and allows
              families with allergies, pregnant women and children to use the
              service. An important part of our concept is the formation of an
              individual solution to the problem. We take into account the
              condition of the product and its material in order to select a
              highly specialized treatment and technology for an effective
              result. At the same time, the cost of our services remains
              affordable for every customer.

            </ul>
            <h3>What to expect from the cleaning?</h3>
            <p>
              Our company's services are aimed at giving the product its
              original appearance and impeccable cleanliness. Even regular
              cleaning using brooms, brushes and vacuum cleaners does not
              provide complete cleanliness. The inhabitants of the house or
              office continue to breathe dust. Moreover, the appearance of
              product surfaces becomes dull and loses its attractiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using safe, natural products for effective cleaning, we remove all
              dust and stains, preserving the texture and rich color of the
              product. After cleaning, all items will regain their original
              appearance, and the room will be pleasantly fresh. To breathe in
              such a space is more pleasant and useful.
            </p>
            <h3>Pricing policy</h3>
            <p>
              High throughput ensures that our customers' costs are kept to a
              minimum. Purchasing expensive professional equipment for home
              cleaning is not rational. In addition, you will need a whole set
              of specialized tools, and most importantly, skills and experience
              that require time and training. Much more profitable will be to
              order the services of experienced cleaners who will arrive at the
              day and time chosen by the customer, professionally and
              inexpensively will carry out a complex of works to remove dirt,
              neutralize odors and antiseptic treatment of products.
            </p>
            <p>
              Comprehensive cleaning is formed based on the client's objectives.
              The company can make a diagnosis of cleanliness and give its
              recommendations on the choice of services, or perform only the
              range of work that the customer chooses. The cost of cleaning and
              dry cleaning depends on the type of items and complexity of the
              work.
            </p>
