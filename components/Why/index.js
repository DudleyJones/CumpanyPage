            <h3>Professional cleaning of furniture – <nobr>why do we need it?</nobr></h3>
            <p>
              A rhetorical question for experienced parents, savvy hotel and
              restaurant administrators, and experienced business center
              managers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clean upholstered furniture – the beauty, solidity, respectability
              of the apartment, office, restaurant. A demonstration of respect
              for yourself and your visitors. The desire to create a space
              filled with harmony and comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another reason why upholstered furniture should be steam-cleaned
              is because the State Sanitary and Hygienic Service controls air
              cleanliness parameters in premises. OSHA for different industries
              directly specifies how the air should be, how upholstered
              furniture should be cleaned, and with what regularity
              steam-cleaning should be performed. The cleanliness of furniture
              is directly related to the amount of dust in the air. For
              violation of sanitary norms managers of enterprises are subject to
              fines, and the facility may be closed until clean up is done. As
              long as the facility is closed, its owner suffers a loss.
            </p>
            <p>
              The air polluted with dust from upholstered furniture causes an
              increase in airborne respiratory diseases. This is unacceptable in
              living rooms, offices, hotels, health care and education
              facilities.
            </p>
            <h3>Clean furniture – prestige and reputation</h3>
            <p>
              The air with the smell of dust and stained furniture in the
              restaurant, beauty salon, hotel is unacceptable. In the face of
              growing competition managers of enterprises do not ask the
              question – "Why do we need dry cleaning of furniture and
              cleanliness of the premises?" Coziness and comfort – important
              elements of a good reputation with customers. If you wanted your
              business to be successful, you should clean your upholstered
              corners and sofas in time.
            </p>
            <h3>Easy clearance of scheduled and unscheduled inspections</h3>
            <p>
              The arrangement of cleaning predetermines the relationship of the
              company with the inspectors. Do you want trouble? They will start
              as soon as the control measurement of air purity reveals a
              deviation from the sanitary standard.
            </p>
            <p>

            <h3>Health and eco-friendly living space</h3>
            <p>
              The most important purpose why eco-friendly upholstery cleaning is
              needed – people's health. They are more likely to get sick
              breathing dusty air. If 3 square feet of carpeting is not cleaned
              for a year, it will collect up to 2 pounds of dust. Textile
              furniture upholstery has the same properties. A dusty chair or
              sofa, as well as curtains and mattresses are real-time bombs for
              the well-being of children and adults.
            </p>
            <p>
              Doctors believe that one of the causes of dust allergies is the
              microscopic saprophyte-mites living in it. It is not even the
              mites that are dangerous, but the products of their life activity,
              which include powerful allergens. They cause a persistent runny
              nose, cough, bronchitis, and exacerbation of bronchial asthma.
