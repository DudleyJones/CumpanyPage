            <h2>How to fight mold and odor from a sofa?</h2>
            <p>
              The sofa is subjected to daily aggression because the upholstery
              absorbs sweat and skin secret, liquids are spilled on it and food
              is dropped on it. Dust, keratinized skin flakes, hair and pet
              hair, crumbs and other debris also settle in the structure of the
              material. As a result, it creates a breeding environment for
              pathogens, fungus, dust mites, lice and other parasites. All this
              can be prevented by using a number of simple tips:

                up with a cloth or paper towel. Be sure to cover the wet area

            <h2>How to clean an old sofa from mold with a soapy solution?</h2>
            <p>
              If you do not want to order cleaning of furniture – then you can
              remove mold yourself with an ordinary soap solution. Prepare and
              apply the solution as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Take one glass of pure water at room temperature.</li>
              <li>
                Add 1 tbsp. of colorless liquid soap to the water, stir the
                components until a stiff foam forms.
              </li>
              <li>
                Distribute the foam over the upholstery, paying special
                attention to areas covered with mold.
              </li>
              <li>Remove the foam with a damp sponge.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Try to use more foam and less water, otherwise the upholstery will
              be very wet. After the job is done, open the windows and turn on
              the fan, pointing it toward the sofa. The fan will improve air
              circulation and also reduce humidity, having a negative effect on
              fungus spores.

            <h2>How do I get mold out of my couch with alcohol?</h2>
            <p>
              Alcohol helps not only to remove cat urine from the couch, but
              also to remove mold residues and spores. To treat, you need to
              prepare a solution of equal amounts of alcohol and water. The
              solution should be poured into a sprayer, and then it should be
              sprayed on the soiled areas. It is forbidden to mix alcohol with
              bleach, because chloroform is formed as a result, which can lead
              to unconsciousness or severe dizziness.

            <h2>How to get rid of mold in general?</h2>
            <p>
              Mold can appear in absolutely any room, becoming the cause of
              unpleasant odors, allergies, various diseases, etc. That is why it
              is important to know the causes of mold in apartments, as well as
              some of the most effective ways to combat the already formed and
              developed fungus.
            </p>
            <h2>Types of mold and harms</h2>
            <p>
              Mold fungus often appears in our homes, which can be of several
              types:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                White mold usually appears in flower pots as a reaction to
                excessive moisture or the use of certain fertilizers. Human
                exposure can manifest as allergies.
              </li>
              <li>
                Green mold can appear on food: eating contaminated food is a
                risk of serious illness. Green mold also occasionally affects
                building materials such as bricks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Black mold is a number one enemy. It is the most common type of
                mold that can affect any surface: wallpaper, paint, plaster,
                boards, concrete, etc. If left unchecked, it can cause insomnia,
                dizziness, fever, headaches, and in the worst cases, asthma,
                bronchitis, dermatitis, pneumonia, and even lung cancer.
              </li>
              <li>
                Blue mold often appears on wooden surfaces in the house:
                parquet, frames, furniture, etc. They begin to acquire an
                unpleasant muddy blue shade, it destroys the layer of paint, and
                even the paint coating unable to protect it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Rot mold is another enemy of wood. Depending on certain
                features, the wood may turn gray or brown, become lighter,
                become cracked, etc.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              None of the finishing materials known to us can resist mold. But
              in addition to damage to the repair process, it is also toxic to
              the human body, especially children. Depending on the level of
              spread of mold in the apartment, the symptoms may be different:
              first the respiratory system is affected, and then the whole body.
              Evidence of the negative impact of the fungus becomes the
              appearance of a cough, runny nose, shortness of breath, difficult
              to diagnose chronic diseases – all these are the cause of being in
              a damp room contaminated with mold.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/e7.jpg" alt="different types of mold" />
            <p>
              Mold can also cause nausea, vomiting, headaches and fatigue. In
              addition to the fact that it looks unaesthetic, it also has a
              destructive effect on building materials: it penetrates the
              structure, quickly spreads and occupies more and more areas.
              That's why once even a trace of mold is detected, it must be
              eliminated immediately.
            </p>
            <h2>Causes and signs of mold</h2>

              layer dries, you can start decorating: wallpapering, painting the
              walls, plastering, etc.

              <span className="span-bold">Method #2: Bleach</span>
              <br />
              Bleach is a simpler way to get rid of mold in the house, a worthy
              alternative to professional products. An ordinary bleach contains
              sodium hypochlorite (it is also present in many special products
              as an active ingredient) which has a destructive effect on mold
              and its spores, so it is a reliable way to get rid of almost all
              types of mold. But you can't use bleach on all surfaces, because
              they can fade, deteriorate, etc. Bleach is great for glass, tile,
              bathtub, other non-porous materials, but is powerless for drywall,
              wood, etc. The fact is that the active ingredient, chlorine, in
              this case does not penetrate into the material where the mold
              particles are located and acts only on the surface. And the water
              that is part of such a solution is absorbed by porous materials,
              leading to even greater development of mold.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working with bleach is difficult to call safe, because it can
              corrode the skin of the hands, cause poisoning by toxic vapors.
              Therefore, it can be used only in a well-ventilated room and with
              rubber protective gloves. The solution is prepared from bleach and
              water in the ratio of 1:10, applied with a brush and waited for
              complete drying. As in the previous case, the damaged surface
              should be cleaned in advance.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Method #3: Vinegar</span>
              <br />
              Ordinary vinegar, which everyone has in the kitchen, is a weak
              acid that is a poison to many types of mold. The good thing about
              it is that it doesn't produce any dangerous fumes, so it's
              perfectly safe to use.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vinegar is sprayed on the prepared surface, and then it is wiped
              with a moistened cloth, rinsed with water after an hour and the
              room is well aired. On particularly damaged areas, it is better to
              carry out such a procedure several times at intervals of one week.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Method #4: Hydrogen Peroxide</span>
              <br />
              Hydrogen peroxide is another poison for most types of mold. You
              can buy a 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide in any pharmacy. Its
              smell is not so harmful to humans, so it is more or less
              convenient to work with it. It should be applied to a prepared
              surface cleaned of mold, but since peroxide also has a bleaching
              effect, it is better not to apply it to painted surfaces, but to
              choose another method.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Method #5: Ammonia Alcohol</span>
              <br />
              Ammonia in action is similar to bleach: it is excellent solution
              against mold on hard non-porous surfaces, but not very effective
              on porous materials. It does its job well when mold has formed,
              for example, on tile or glass.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ammonia must be mixed with water in a 1:1 ratio and sprayed on the
              infected surface, and an hour later wash off the solution with
              water and ventilate the room well. Work with ammonia should be
              very careful, because its pungent smell can cause dizziness,
              headaches, etc. Be careful, and do not try to use it in
              combination with bleach, as the reaction between them leads to the
              release of toxic gases.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Method #6: Baking soda</span>
              <br />
              Soda is one of the easiest and safest ways to get rid of mold, and
              it does not harm either humans or pets. It is enough to prepare a
              solution of baking soda – a teaspoon dissolved in a glass of water
              – and the resulting composition to spray on the surface affected
              by mold. You can also wipe moldy things, walls, objects with a
              sponge soaked in this solution. After an hour, the surface should
              be rinsed with water, but it is not recommended to completely
              rinse the soda solution from it: soda is not capable of damaging
              the material, but it perfectly protects against the reappearance
              of fungus.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Method #7: Borax</span>
              <br />
              Borax is a natural material, so it cannot harm human health. It is
              often used in disinfecting toilets and drains, acts as an
              effective fungicide, insecticide and herbicide, in general, is an
              inhibitor of mold development and a toxin for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is recommended that before you start the work on cleaning the
              mold first vacuum the surface with a fine filter, so that in the
              following process as little pores fly in the air and get into your
              lungs as possible. The working solution is prepared as follows: 1
              cup of borax is diluted in 2.5 liters of water. The borax solution
              is applied to the surface with a stiff brush, while scrubbing the
              fungus itself from the walls, objects, floor, etc. It is advisable
              to go over the surface with such a solution several times, it is
              not necessary to wash off anything, as in the future borax will
              become a reliable protector against mold.

              <span className="span-bold">Method #8: Tea tree oil</span>
              <br />
              Tea tree oil is one of the most effective natural remedies, which
              are absolutely harmless to humans. Although such oil is not cheap,
              but you will need it very little, it has strong antibacterial and
              antifungal agents.
            </p>
            <p>
              One teaspoon of tea tree oil per glass of water will be needed.
              This mixture is added to a sprayer and applied to the damaged
              surface, or use to apply it on a sponge, you will not need to wash
              it off, as this solution will reliably protect against the
              possible reappearance of the fungus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tea tree has its own specific smell, but it is harmless and will
              disappear after a while. By the way, the prepared anti-mold
              solution can be stored for as long as you want, because over time,
              it does not lose its strength and does not deteriorate.

              <br />
              This remedy resembles tea tree oil in its effect. It is also
              expensive, but it is odorless, disinfectant and deodorizing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The solution is very simple to prepare: only 10 drops of
              grapefruit seed extract per glass of water. Again, use a sprayer
              for application, and after application do not wash off the
              solution, because the longer its contact with the damaged surface,
              the better, and in the future this solution will protect the walls
              and floors from the appearance of new mold stains.

              Manganese solution also has a detrimental effect on mold. A weak
              mixture of manganese solution can be applied to the damaged
              surface: add a tablespoon of potassium permanganate to 1 liter of
              water and apply it to the damaged area, or wipe it off. You can
              leave this solution unwiped, it will be effective for some time.

              These oils contain substances that can counteract the development
              and activity of mold, so it is sufficient to add a few drops of
              scented oil in a glass of water, and then treat the surface: there
              will be no unpleasant chemical odor. These oils are non-toxic for

              Many craftsmen get rid of mold with the help of office glue, which
              is diluted one to one with water. The method is effective in some
              cases, but does not cope with all types of mold, and if the

              Iodine solution and camphor balls are only helpful if you have
              just discovered small traces of mold and do not want to use more
              aggressive methods of struggle. Therefore, you can place

              weak organic acid that has a negative effect on the development of
              fungus. A teaspoon of citric acid is dissolved in a glass of

              Even if you have carried out the fight against mold in accordance
              with all the instructions, there is still no guarantee that it
              will not appear again. It is important not only to remove the

              possible causes of its reappearance. That is why it is necessary:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Insulate your apartment or house reliably.</li>
              <li>Repair or replace the heating system.</li>
              <li>Install an air conditioner to dry the air.</li>
              <li>Set up a ventilation system.</li>
              <li>
                Dry your laundry on the balcony instead of your room or get a

              <li>
                Such flowers as geraniums and violets are excellent breeding
                grounds for mold, so you should limit their presence in the
                apartment.

            <h2>How to remove the smell of mold?</h2>
            <p>
              Often after the removal of mold from the apartment and the
              subsequent airing of the smell of rot still does not leave the
              room. You can fight it with products that absorb odors. So, on the
              place where the fungus used to be, you can pour baking soda, and
              after a few hours remove it with a vacuum cleaner: baking soda
              perfectly absorbs odors, so after such a procedure, the smell will
              either disappear or become much weaker.
            </p>
            <p>
              Charcoal can be used as an odor absorber: briquettes are simply
              placed around the room with an unpleasant odor, and after a while
              there will be no trace of it.

            <h2>A few more tips when fighting mold</h2>
            <p>
              Mold in every room is different, so the approaches to fighting it
              should be slightly different.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Removing mold from walls</span>
              <br />
              At the first signs of mold, you should act immediately, because
              after 10-12 months it can get to the concrete or brickwork.
              Therefore, you should remove the damaged layer of finish, wet the
              wall a little so that mold spores do not fly around the room, then
              remove a layer of plaster, then scrub thoroughly all the mold and
              sweep the room very well. Dry the walls and treat them with the
              selected antimold product.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the walls are painted, mold spreads more over the area than
              inside, and once the paint coating is removed, you can begin the
              process of decontamination, going from simpler remedies to the
              most powerful ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sheetrock ceilings and walls have a different structure: they are
              porous, so you need to consider that mold can develop deep into
              the material. In this case, professional products are suitable.
            </p>
            <p>
              In rooms with wallpaper fungus spreads at lightning speed, so in
              most cases you have to remove the wallpaper. This can only be
              avoided in the initial stages of mold development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ideal for fighting fungus in this case, is a solution of vinegar,
              ammonia alcohol, special compositions, lavender oil, manganese
              solution or hydrogen peroxide solution. But it is unlikely to
              avoid the dismantling of at least part of the wallpaper, as all of
              these remedies can slightly change their color, and the
              possibility that mold is already firmly settled in the apartment
              and grows under the wallpaper, is high.
            </p>

              <br />
              In the bathroom, the most vulnerable places are the joints between
              the plumbing and the wall, treated with sealant, as well as the
              joints between the tiles. There very quickly appears a black stain
              that does not wash off – it is a mold.
            </p>
            <p>
              Follow the old technique: remove the affected area, i.e. moldy
              sealant, treat with the selected product, and reapply sealant.
              Joints between the tiles are cleaned with a metal scrubber, and
              then use a primer with antiseptic properties in there.
            </p>
            <p>
              If mold appeared on the ceiling, then moisten that area and leave
              for 2-3 hours, then remove the whitewash and plaster, and putty
              all roughness on the ceiling. Then use a primer, which includes
              antifungal agents, and after it dries, apply a penetrating primer.
              It remains only to sand the surface, and the ceiling is ready for
              further finishing.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also make it differently with applying a whitewash, baking
              soda, vinegar or tea tree solution to the affected area of the
              bathroom ceiling.

            <p>
              Often we underestimate the harm that can cause us seemingly
              ordinary mold. It is extremely dangerous not only for building
              materials, but also for health, so it is necessary to fight it at
              the first appearance. But it is also important to eliminate the
              causes of mold in order to get rid of them as well, otherwise all
              efforts may be ineffective.
