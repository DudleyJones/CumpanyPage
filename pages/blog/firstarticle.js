          <h2>
            General rules for removing wine stains from upholstered furniture
          </h2>
          <p>
            Red wine contains in its composition a high percentage of sugar, so
            after getting on the carpet, it forms a dense sticky film, as well
            as a bright scarlet stain. It is recommended to deal with the
            consequences of this little disaster immediately, because it will be
            much more difficult to remove the old stain. Doing the cleaning, you
            can take a few useful tips as a basis:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use cool sparkling water. It contains active air bubbles, which
              effectively break down impurities. By the way, the method can be
              used to clean dried blood from any kind of base.
            </li>
            <li>
              Collect as much liquid as possible with a dry wipe before
              cleaning.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any compound should be tested on a small area of the upholstery.
              For example, citric acid, hydrogen peroxide or alcohol can
              discolor the fabric, and hot liquids have a detrimental effect on
              wool products.
            </li>
            <li>
              Never use white wine to remove red wine – this method will only
              make things worse.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not try to scrub the stain quickly, otherwise it may enlarge.
              As you clean, move from the edges to the center.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A fresh wine stain can be covered with baking soda, because the
            absorbent will quickly absorb the liquid. Another good option is
            salt, which you should also pour on the stain. You can also prepare
            a thick paste of salt and water, which should be removed after 5-10
            minutes after application.

          <h2>How to remove red wine from a sofa using hydrogen peroxide?</h2>
          <p>
            Hydrogen peroxide is the best remedy for all types of stains, but it
            can discolor the material. If you are cleaning an old stain, you can
            treat it with undiluted hydrogen peroxide:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Apply the product to a sponge or a textile cloth.</li>
            <li>Treat the wine polluted spot.</li>
            <li>Wipe the cleaned area with a damp sponge.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If the stain is fresh, you can get rid of it using the method below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Combine 2 tbsp. of colorless liquid soap with 1 tbsp. of hydrogen
              peroxide.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mix the ingredients and work on the soiled area, moving from the
              edges to the center.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rinse the upholstery with water; if the trace is still there, the
              procedure can be repeated.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Remember that after any kind of cleaning application, the upholstery
            should be wet cleaned, which will remove the components of
            chemicals, as well as sugar contained in the wine.

          <p>
            If you need to clean cork, cotton or other types of synthetic and
            natural materials from wine, then ordinary medical alcohol will be
            useful. Combine it with water in equal parts, apply it to the
            contamination, using a sprayer. Wait 5-10 minutes, wipe the
            upholstery with a damp sponge or wipes.

            How to remove wine stains from a couch with citric acid and lemon
            juice?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Citric acid and freshly squeezed lemon juice are excellent for
            removing stains resulting from contact with red wine. A solution
            made with citric acid is less aggressive than undiluted citrus
            juice:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Add 1 teaspoon of citric acid to 100 ml of room temperature water.
            </li>
            <li>Stir the solution, pour it into a sprayer.</li>
            <li>
              Apply the product spraying it on the upholstery, leave it for 5-7
              minutes, then remove it with a soft, damp sponge.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Old dirt can be wiped with undiluted lemon juice, but this method is
            more suitable for light-colored upholstery, because the juice
            discolors the material.

            How to get rid of the red wine smell and dry out my furniture?
          </h2>
          <p>
            If after cleaning the furniture exudes an unpleasant wine smell, the
            treated area can be covered with a layer of baking soda. The baking
            soda should be left for 12 hours. It can be removed with a vacuum
            cleaner. Note that you can get rid of the smell of vomit, wine,
            urine with a solution of vinegar (do not mix with baking soda!):
            combine 50 ml of vinegar, and the same amount of water, apply to the
            upholstery with a sprayer, do not forget to make a wet clean.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wet fabric needs proper drying, otherwise it may become covered with
            mold or fungus. For drying, use natural ventilation (open windows,
            creating a draught), you can also turn on the air conditioner, fan
            or dehumidifier. Do not use irons, hair dryers, heaters, because
            they can have a negative effect on the upholstery.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are unable to clean the red wine yourself, contact a cleaning
            company. Specialists will determine the composition of the material,
            and then perform the proper cleaning and subsequent drying. After
            professional cleaning the sofa will look great, because the cleaners
            will remove small stains, signs of wear and tear, pet fur and
            unpleasant odors.

          <h2>How to remove red wine stains with Persil</h2>
          <p>
            There are many kinds of red wine. No matter what kind you choose to
            enjoy pasta, steak or snacks, inadvertently dropping wine glass over
            will inevitably leave a deep mark on things. Before laundering red
            wine, read the information on the label of your item. Then follow
            the recommendations below:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Choose a Persil laundry detergent according to the type of fabric
              you want to wash.
            </li>
            <li>
              After the wine has come into contact with the garment, apply
              (without rubbing) this detergent to the soiled area as soon as
              possible (read more about stain pretreatment above).
            </li>
            <li>

          <h2>Ways to remove stains very quickly</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes a stain on a garment appears in the midst of a celebration
            when there is no way to do the laundry. There are two great ways to
            remove a red wine stain in the place and quickly return to your
            guests. You won't need any special remedies – only handy tools:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Take the necessary number of dry paper towels and start soaking
              the wine stain to squeeze all the moisture out of the clothes. Try
              to do this as quickly as possible, because it's much easier to
              remove the stain immediately than it is to remove a red wine stain
              that has been there for a while.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the stain is large and difficult, take some salt with you from
              the table to the bathroom, stir it in a little cold water to make
              a paste. This mixture should be applied to the red wine stain, and
              then gently rub it. After a few minutes, brush off the remains of
              salt and stain from the surface of the clothes, wipe the spot with
              a napkin and go back to the table.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These ways of how to remove a wine stain are good if you are not at
            home, for which reason you are very limited in the choice of
            available remedies. If you are at home, or the stain is large or
            old, you might want to look into more effective ways to get wine
            stains out of your clothes. Every minute counts, so try to treat
            your clothes as quickly as possible.

            How to remove wine stains from the upholstery of sofas, carpets and
            clothes, if the above recipes do not help? Unfortunately, there are
            very few methods of dealing with old stains, because wine is firmly
            absorbed into the fibers, it is quite difficult to remove it
            afterwards. Try not to let colored liquor get on your clothes, and
            even if you encounter this trouble, start removing the stains as
            early as possible. Remember that wiping off fresh stains is much
            easier than getting rid of those that have already had time to eat
            deeply. Finally, the best way dealing with such pollution is to call
            for a professional cleaning company.
