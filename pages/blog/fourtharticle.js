            <h1>How to clean a sofa with Vanish?</h1>
            <p>
              Vanish is a well-known product for cleaning carpets and upholstery
              on sofas. In household chemicals stores you can see a huge
              selection of pink bottles, cans, sprays and other forms of this
              product. From this article you will learn how to understand this
              variety of cleaning compositions and how to clean the sofa with
              Vanish correctly, without damaging its upholstery.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/d1.jpg" alt="A row of different Vanishes" />
            <h2>So many Vanishes</h2>
            <p>
              The manufacturer of household chemicals offers a whole line of
              products under the Vanish brand – shampoos, gels, foams, sprays,
              and powders. Among them are stain removers, compositions for odor
              removal, antibacterial agents and shampoos for wet cleaning of
              sofas. In essence, the products of the Vanish line do not differ
              much, except in form and method of application. So here's what a
              housewife needs to know about Vanish.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, despite the manufacturer's claimed versatility, Vanish is
              only suitable for furniture with thick upholstery materials:
              Chenille, jacquard, burlap, tapestry or fleeces.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Attention!</strong> –
              <span className="span-italic">
                In no case do not use Vanish to clean the sofa upholstered in
                silk, velvet, velour, and do not wipe with it metal and wooden
                elements of decoration!
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Secondly, do not use Vanish to clean a sofa with bright
              upholstery. The composition of absolutely all products of this
              manufacturer includes an oxygen-containing bleach. Its effect is
              to eliminate unwanted stains. We are talking about stains like
              berries and fruits, coffee, fibre pens, food – anything that in
              contact with the sofa upholstery leaves color marks on it. But, as
              a rule, along with the stain the coloring of the upholstery
              material is wiped away. Needless to say, Vanish is categorically
              unsuitable for cleaning leather furniture?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Attention!</strong> –
              <span className="span-italic">
                By using Vanish to clean brightly colored sofas, you are in risk
                of discoloration of the dye on the upholstery. Before scrubbing
                a stain, always test the product on a small area of the sofa to
                see how the textile reacts to the chemical composition!
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, Vanish is powerless against stubborn stains. It is not a
              professional product, so it has a gentle composition, not capable
              of removing difficult stains.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Attention!</strong> –
              <span className="span-italic">
                Do not use Vanish to remove stubborn stains, blood stains, urine
                stains, ballpoint pens or coffee stains. This may cause streaks.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              However, you should not treat Vanish so unequivocally, blame the
              manufacturer and rush to get rid of the cherished pink bottles. In
              some cases, cleaning the couch with Vanish is really possible.
              Shampoo of this lineup has notable advantages: means it is very
              economical – at a low price they suffice for almost six months of
              use, the composition does not contain chlorine and it is clearly
              safe for all family members. Vanish is easy to use, but to avoid
              damaging the furniture, listen to our advice.

            <h2>Clean your couch with Vanish at home</h2>
            <p>
              If a fresh stain has appeared on your sofa from food, drink, baby
              food – in most cases, you can cope with such contamination with
              Vanish. We tell you how to properly clean the sofa with this tool.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Vanish solution should not be too concentrated or too weak.
                The correct ratio of cleaning fluid to water is 1:9 – 1 cap of
                product to 9 caps of water. Use no more than 40°C – 104°Fwater
                to prepare the solution.
              </li>
              <li>
                Whisk the solution until it is foamy. To do this, stir
                vigorously with your hand, sponge or brush in the bowl.
              </li>
              <li>
                Take only the foam on a brush or sponge and rub it into the
                upholstery with a circular motion.
              </li>
              <li>
                To avoid streaks, it is better to clean the entire couch, even
                if you wanted to get rid of a small stain. After brushing, leave
                the foam on the surface until it is completely dry. When the
                sofa is dry, vacuum it properly.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you've spilled any kind of dirty liquid on your couch, it's a
              good idea to sprinkle Vanish over the stain first. As you prepare
              the cleaning solution, the powder will absorb the liquid,
              preventing it from penetrating deeper into the upholstery. Sweep
              off the powder with a brush or vacuum the sofa, then proceed with
              the foam cleaning method described above.
            </p>
            <p>
              The easiest way is to use Vanish spray. To clean the sofa with it,
              you do not need to mix anything in advance. The composition is
              ready to use – just shake it and spray a thin layer on the surface
              of the sofa. Leave the composition for 5 minutes, soak up the
              remaining moisture with a dry cloth and simply vacuum the sofa.
            </p>
            <p>

              your home in general as well as your carpets, sofas and
              mattresses. Below we would like to list the most popular and
              effective products of this company. The use of these products does
              not guarantee complete removal of stains, but can be quite

            <h2>Removing stains with Tide</h2>
            <p>
              Of similar products to Vanish, we can also note the
              <em>"Tide To Go"</em>, used by many consumers. How many times has
              this happened to you? You're eating in a restaurant when suddenly
              a drop of ketchup gets on your new T-shirt. You rub and rub, but
              it only makes the stain bigger and spread even more. With Tide to
              Go, you can make the stains less noticeable or even get them out
              pretty good! A product developed by Tide, the Tide to Go Pencil is
              an instant stain remover, and because of its pencil size, it's
              perfect to carry with you at all times! Many people often use it
              not only to remove stains from clothing but also from furniture
              upholstery and car interiors. Tide To Go is very simple to use:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Remove any residual stain with a cloth. It should just be a
                stain, without any solid particles.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you are using it for the first time, remove the cap and press
                the tip of the pencil several times until the liquid comes out.
              </li>
              <li>
                To remove a stain, press the tip of the stain on it several
                times to squeeze out the product.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gently rub the tip of the pencil over the stain to wipe it off.
                You can also blot the stain with a paper towel.
              </li>
              <li>
                Allow the product to dry. You'll get a pretty noticeable wet
                spot, but once it dries, the contamination is gone!
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The product works best when the stains are fresh and not dried
              out. Thanks to the small packaging, this product is convenient to
              use to remove stains wherever you are. Food and beverage stains
              like ketchup or barbecue sauce, coffee, tea and wine are easier to
              remove. As a rule, stains from oil, ink, blood and grass are not
              recommended to remove in this manner.
