            <h1>Cleaning cat urine from the couch</h1>
            <p>
              Even a well-mannered cat trained to the litter box, from time to
              time may cause trouble to the owner in the form of urine stains on
              upholstered furniture. This happens most often when the pet is
              offended or not getting the attention it wants. Or maybe you just
              carelessly closed a door, behind which is the litter box, and the
              pet can not cope with it. By the way, a dirty litter box doesn't
              tempt cats either – they are very clean by nature! So do not
              forget a simple rule: forgot to change the litter box filler in
              time – expect a surprise. In any case, every cat owner should know
              how to clean the couch from cat urine. This knowledge will help to
              save the furniture and maintain a good relationship with your
              beloved pet.

            <h2>Is it even possible to get rid of urine smell?</h2>
            <p>
              Cat urine has a high content of uric acid, that is why it has such
              a persistent pungent smell. It also crystallizes very quickly
              inside the upholstery. The sooner you find the urine stain on the
              couch and start to remove it, the better the chances of getting
              rid of the cat urine smell completely on your own. Once the stain
              penetrates deep into the upholstery and dries there, it will be
              useless to fight with it.
            </p>

            <h2>How to remove the smell of cat urine from the couch?</h2>
            <p>
              Alcohol, lemon or vinegar, and baking soda or fine table salt are
              good for removing cat urine. Also prepare in advance a light soapy
              solution and stock up on clean dry wipes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Step One</span>
              <br />
              The first step is to remove all moisture immediately. To do this,
              apply clean, dry wipes to the stain to absorb the liquid. Change
              the wipes until there are no more wet marks on them.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Attention!</strong> – <span className="span-italic">Don't apply too much pressure, or
              you'll push the liquid deeper into the furniture upholstery!</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Step Two</span>
              <br />
              Sprinkle baking soda or salt over the stain and leave it for 30
              minutes. You can also use starch or flour ­­– whatever you find at
              home. The powder will absorb any remaining moisture from the
              upholstery and keep it from leaking deeper.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Step Three</span>
              <br />
              The smell of cat urine lends itself quite well to a soapy
              solution. The glycerin in the soap breaks down the urine, even if
              it has begun to dry out. To clean cat urine from your couch, grate
              some soap into pure, warm water. Lather the mixture well – you
              will only need the foam to clean, not the liquid itself. Use a dry
              sponge to take the foam and dab it onto the stain. Do not rub it
              in! Leave the foam for 15-20 minutes, then remove it with a clean,
              slightly damp cloth or sponge.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Step Four</span>
              <br />
              Lemon will complete the procedure and make the couch smell fresh.
              Lemon juice is a natural oxidizing agent that is great for
              dissolving uric acid crystals. Squeeze the lemon onto a sponge and
              apply it several times to the stain. Repeat the procedure after
              20-30 minutes. One lemon is enough for two treatments. If you
              don't have lemon, use citric acid, dissolving 4 teaspoons in a
              glass of water.
            </p>
            <em>
              Instead of lemon and citric acid, you can also use alcohol or a
              light vinegar solution.
            </em>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Step Five</span>
              <br />
              After wet cleaning with vinegar, lemon or rubbing alcohol,
              sprinkle the area with baking soda or salt again. These will
              absorb any residual moisture after cleaning and help prevent
              streaks from appearing on the upholstery.
            </p>

            <h2>Removing cat urine smell with hydrogen peroxide</h2>
            <p>
              Based on the experience of the majority of cat owners, hydrogen
              peroxide is
              <span className="span-bold"> one of the most effective remedies </span>
              for removing cat urine odor. Besides, you can definitely find
              hydrogen peroxide in every home. But we recommend being very
              careful when using hydrogen peroxide. In most cases, it corrodes
              the urine crystals along with the upholstery. After such
              treatment, there are often rips or white spills appear on the
              surface of the sofa.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cleaning with peroxide is good for removing cat urine odor from
              light-colored leather furniture. Peroxide does not harm the
              upholstery by penetrating the pores of the leather and does an
              excellent job of breaking down the urine. But it is better to
              avoid using it on textile upholstery.
            </p>
            <img

            />
            <h2>Removing cat urine smell with manganese and iodine</h2>
            <p>
              A weak solution of iodine or manganese is
              <span className="span-bold">recommended for cleaning dark sofas</span>
              . Iodine and manganese do not corrode the fabric, so they do not
              leave behind rips and white splotches. You could say it's a
              gentler option for cleaning cat urine from your sofa on its own.
              But at the same time it is also less effective. They have a
              deodorizing effect, but do not really cope with the decomposition
              of urine crystals. This means that the stain will not be
              completely removed. After some time, the smell may return with the
              same strength.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is possible that with one time to completely remove the smell
              of cat urine from the couch will not work, and the procedure will
              have to be repeated. In this case, it is better to try different
              remedies. Make the first clean with, for example, lemon juice, on
              the second run to try alcohol or vinegar. But each time, before
              you start cleaning, check the reaction of the upholstery in an
              inconspicuous place. This could be the gap between the backrest
              and seat or the back of the sofa. If the fabric doesn't discolor
              or rub off from the chosen solution, you can begin cleaning.

            <h2>Urine stain dried long ago – how to get rid of the smell?</h2>
            <p>
              A stale urine stain has no less of an odor than a fresh one. Over
              time, it does not weatherize and does not become any smaller. But,
              unfortunately, it is impossible to remove such a stain, if it is
              dry, by your own efforts. Do not believe if on the Internet you
              see the advice to remove urine with chlorine. First, chlorine only
              temporarily deodorizes the smell, which will return soon.
              Secondly, chlorine is a very aggressive agent, the effects of
              which the upholstery is unlikely to withstand.

            <h2>How to find an urine spot?</h2>
            <p>
              Cat urine has a pungent scent that instantly fills the room,
              making it very difficult to find the stain. If you can't find the
              trail, get a UV lamp or a UV flashlight (available at any hardware
              store) and then proceed as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Wait until the night time or close the curtains – it should be
                dark in the room. You can turn on lights in adjoining rooms or
                use a regular flashlight.
              </li>
              <li>Get a source of ultraviolet light, examine the couch.</li>
              <li>
                The urine stain glows in UV light, it is colored yellow or
                green.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Having found a spot, you should fix its size, using improvised
              things, such as a piece of paper placing it at the area where the
              spot is located. As part of the proper maintenance of upholstered
              furniture, it is necessary to remove the stain, because it is not
              only a source of unpleasant odor, but also the best breeding
              ground for bacteria and microorganisms.

            <h2>What should not be used to wash cat urine off from a couch?</h2>
            <p>
              Do not try to clean sofa stains with ammonia-based products,
              because its smell may attract the cat, so your pet will use the
              place as a toilet again. Do not use chlorine-based chemicals, pure
              alcohol or aggressive stain removers, which can cause
              discoloration, distortion and accelerated wear and tear on the
              upholstery. Do not mask the smell by spraying perfumes and
              fragrances. Refuse to use solutions based on iodine and manganese,
              bleach – all this will cause irreparable damage to the upholstery,
              which can't be repaired even by cleaning the sofa at home,
              performed by professionals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before using common public methods, be sure to test for a
              reaction:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Apply a small amount of the mixture to the soiled area.</li>
              <li>Leave it for 30 minutes.</li>
              <li>
                Check the upholstery, if it is not faded or deformed, you can
                perform a full cleaning.
              </li>
            </ul>

              How to remove the smell of dog pee from your carpet and couch?
            </h2>
            <p>
              If you are a happy owner of a dog, you probably know that in
              addition to the joy and comfort it can also cause some troubles.
              Many dog owners face the problem of unpleasant urine odor, which
              is not easy to clean up. I will tell you about the ways to solve
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this purpose, you can use the usual products that you use in
              the general cleaning process. For example, Mr. Muscle or Mr.
              Proper:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Dilute the substance in a large amount of water.</li>
              <li>
                Apply the solution to the damaged area, rub it with a dry brush.
              </li>
              <li>Rinse the surface with water.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Hydrogen peroxide, baking soda and dishwashing liquid. This recipe
              will help remove unpleasant odor from tile or linoleum:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Mix 20 ml of hydrogen peroxide with a tablespoon of dishwashing
                liquid and two tablespoons of baking soda.
              </li>
              <li>Apply the mixture to the soiled area.</li>
              <li>Scrub the surface with a stiff brush.</li>
              <li>Wait about two hours.</li>
              <li>Rinse the surface with water.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Of course, nothing will get the stain and odor out more
              effectively than a professional cleaning. Only a powerful
              commercial extractor can penetrate deep into the sofa upholstery,
              dissolve the old dirt with hot steam and extract it from there.

              How to clean the couch from baby pee using household solutions?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Children's urine is different from the urine of pets and adults.
              Because of the peculiarities of nutrition and the functioning of
              the child's body, it is not as concentrated and aggressive, its
              smell is slightly detectable, but, despite this, measures should
              be taken immediately after the accident.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can clean the couch from the child's urine, if the trouble has
              just occurred, by using ordinary water, to do this, follow these
              steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A napkin or toilet paper, previously folded in several layers,
                is pressed against the wet surface until the moisture is no
                longer absorbed. The wipes should be changed as often as
                possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                Another layer of tissues or an absorbent disposable diaper is
                placed on the stain and then pressed down with something heavy
                for a few minutes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Almost dry sofa fabric is abundantly treated with clean water
                with a spray gun, and then repeat the manipulation with the
                napkins.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Usually these actions are enough to clean the couch from the
              child's urine, but if the stain is old, it can be treated with
              lemon juice and then wiped with a damp cloth. Using products from
              pet stores to clean children's furniture is strictly prohibited.

            <h2>How to clean the couch from adult urine?</h2>
            <p>
              Adult urine has a more pronounced smell than children urine, which
              means that cleaning the smell of urine from the couch will be more
              difficult. You can use special chemical compounds that are sold in
              stores or resort to the help of couch cleaners – everyone decides
              for herself/himself, but there are also less expensive but
              effective ways of cleaning using solutions available to every
              housewife. Here are just a few of them:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A white fabric is generously moistened with a water-based
                solution of vinegar (mixed in 1 vinegar to 5 water) and applied
                to the polluted area for 10-15 minutes, which is then dried
                naturally.
              </li>
              <li>
                Laundry soap foam is applied to the stain, and after 10-20
                minutes, rinse with water and dry the fabric.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lemon juice (mixed 1 juice to 2 water) using a sprayer is
                applied liberally to the surface, and after 30-40 minutes,
                treated with tissues and dried.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You can use conventional carpet and furniture upholstery cleaners.
              It all depends on the nature of the dirt and stubbornness of the
              stain.

              Perhaps the only possible way to get rid of a stale stain and
              smell of cat urine is a
              <span className="span-bold">professional steam cleaning</span>. But
              even professionals with special equipment and skills do not always
              guarantee 100% removal of cat urine stains and odor from
              long-dried urine. The result largely depends on the sofa
              upholstery material.

              Note that steam cleaning may not be effective if you tried to mop
              up the dirty place with improvised solutions or household
              chemicals. Therefore, if your pet presented such a nuisance, as
              urine stains – it is better not to delay and immediately order a
              professional cleaning of upholstered furniture without trying to
              remove the odor yourself. Only in this case, you can be sure that
              the sofa will be really clean and the unpleasant smell will
              disappear!
