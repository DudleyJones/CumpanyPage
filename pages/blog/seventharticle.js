              How to remove wax or paraffin from the carpet?
            </h1>
            <p>
              Many people use scented candles in apartments and private homes,
              which allow you to create an atmosphere of coziness and romance.
              Such candles are made from paraffin or wax, the first material is
              synthetic, the second is natural. During burning, the wax melts,
              which distinguishes it from paraffin, and the droplets can fall on
              upholstered furniture, tables and, of course, carpets. Washing in
              specialized carpet-cleaning facilities can help remove such dirt,
              but you can try to do the cleaning yourself. Today we have
              prepared a great overview of recommendations on how to remove wax
              from the carpet at home.

              Is there a difference in removing stains from a church candle and
              an ordinary candle? Church candles are made of the same wax,
              difficulties may arise only when removing stains from the wax of
              red Easter candles: they contain dye. Only a stain remover can
              help in such cases (of course, after cleaning the fabric from the
              accumulation of wax).
            </p>
            <h2>Wax and paraffin: features</h2>
            <p>
              Natural wax can be vegetable, fossil or animal based. Paraffin is
              a mixture of synthetic but absolutely safe components, and it is
              produced from oil. During contact with fire, the wax melts
              intensively, while paraffin burns completely, releasing a huge
              amount of soot. Wax is soft, its consistency resembles something
              like plasticine, while paraffin crumbles in the hands. Most often
              it is the wax that leaves stains on the carpets. When cleaning the
              coating from such dirt, it is worth taking into account a number
              of recommendations:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It is not a good idea to scrub the melted substance from the
                object. First, it smears, and second, you can burn the skin. You
                need to wait for the wax to harden completely, and then remove
                it with a blunt object: a plastic knife, a banking card.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do not tear off the wax, otherwise some of the pile will be
                detached from the carpet with it.
              </li>
              <li>
                You need to take proper care of the carpet, removing stains as
                soon as they appear.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Wax cannot be dissolved with water, but you can try using alcohol
              and other aggressive substances. Keep in mind that the wrong
              product can cause fading of the surface, as well as change the
              structure of the pile. Be sure to test any cleaning mixture on a
              small area of the carpet!
            </p>

            <p>
              Before doing the job, inspect the back of the rug, as there may be
              a label on it indicating the composition and acceptable methods of
              cleaning the product. These recommendations should be followed,
              because the wool rug does not tolerate heat, and silk carpets are
              sensitive to moisture.

            <h2>How to get wax out of a carpet using ice?</h2>
            <p>
              During freezing, the wax becomes very brittle, so it is relatively
              easy to separate it from the floor covering. You can remove the
              wax using the following instructions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Remove the hard wax from the object using a blunt knife, spoon,
                or other tool that will not damage the carpet.
              </li>
              <li>
                Place a bottle of water in the freezer. You can use ice cubes,
                which should be transferred to a bag.
              </li>
              <li>
                Place a cold bottle, or ice on the contamination, wait 5-10
                minutes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Go over the area to be cleaned with a blunt plastic knife again.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The procedure can be repeated until you have completely cleaned
              the rug.
            </p>

            <h2>How to remove wax from a carpet using heat treatment?</h2>
            <p>
              High temperatures can help get rid of the wax; you can use a hair
              dryer:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Turn on the hair dryer, direct a stream of hot air at the stain.
              </li>
              <li>
                Press a paper or cloth towel, into which the wax will be
                absorbed, to the area to be cleaned.
              </li>
              <li>Repeat the procedure several times.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also use an iron, the work should be done as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cover the contamination with a towel or a paper bag.</li>
              <li>Iron the towel with a hot iron.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you are using a natural cotton towel, you can increase the
              cleaning efficiency by turning on the "Steam" mode.
            </p>

            <h2>Remove wax and paraffin from leather and suede</h2>
            <p>
              To get rid of the wax on leather items, you must let the wax
              harden, then press the leather by hands, the wax will come off by
              itself. If a trace remains, wipe it with a cotton pad or cloth
              soaked with a solution of laundry soap, then – rinse with water
              and let it dry.
            </p>
            <p>
              To remove wax and paraffin from suede, there is a special
              technique: after removing the wax put a clean sheet of paper
              (blotting paper or paper towel) on the stain and put the suede
              garment on a hot, but not overheated iron. Put the suede on the
              iron, not the iron on the suede, otherwise there is a risk of
              deformation of the product. If we are talking about upholstery
              then place a paper sheet between hot iron and suede. The paper
              absorbs the stain, and the suede doesn't start to shine from
              ironing. If the stain doesn't disappear the first time, change the
              paper towel several times.
            </p>

            />
            <p>
              Suede takes a steam treatment well and cleaning with solutions of
              ammonia (0.5 teaspoon of ammonia to 1 liter of cool water).

            <h2>How to clean grease marks left after removing a wax stain?</h2>
            <p>
              After removing the substance, a greasy residue remains on the
              covering, which can be removed with a soapy solution:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Dilute 1 tbsp. of dish detergent in a glass of water.</li>
              <li>Then spray the solution on the contamination.</li>
              <li>Rinse the area with a sponge.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If the stain does not disappear completely, you can wipe the
              coating with a sponge dipped in medical alcohol. Be careful, as
              the alcohol can discolor the surface! You can also use the
              following methods to get rid of a grease stain:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ammonia solution (1:1 in proportion with water).</li>
              <li>White spirit.</li>
              <li>
                Potato starch can be replaced with baking soda, baby powder,
                which should be filled in the soiled area. It perfectly absorbs
                grease, after 4-5 hours; the coating should be vacuumed.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="/images/g6.jpg" alt="Grease marks on couch upholstery" />
            <p>
              After applying these products, be sure to rinse the rug with clean
              water and then blot it with a towel to remove as much moisture as
              possible. If you are preparing the rug for storage, you must wait
              until it is completely dry or it may become moldy.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you can't get the stains and wax off yourself, it's worth
              requesting an in-home carpet cleaning service. The cleaning
              company will choose a safe and highly effective method of
              cleaning!

            <p>

            <h2>Washing wax crayons off the wallpaper</h2>
            <p>
              Most of us have kids, and as we know kids like to draw anywhere,
              not only on paper but also on the walls. Unexpected traces of wax
              crayons on the wallpaper will not make anyone happy except kids.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the wallpaper is washable, you can use rubber glue: apply a
                thin layer of glue to the pencil drawings, and when it dries –
                remove the adhesive film along with the remains of the wax
                crayons on the wallpaper.
              </li>
              <li>
                On washable wallpaper, you can wipe the pictures with a cloth
                soaked in mayonnaise, baking soda, Mr Proper floor cleaner or
                shaving foam. Leave the product on the soiled area for a few
                minutes and then wipe it off with a damp cloth.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the wallpaper is paper made, moisten the wax pencil drawings
                with gasoline (it is important to air the room well afterwards)
                or paint remover. You can also use children's wet wipes.

              <li>Put a paper towel or blotting paper on top.</li>
              <li>
                Put a small weight on top – a cup of water will work and leave
                it for an hour and a half.
              </li>
              <li>
                Remove the paper towel and clean – first with a medium-hard
                brush or with a toothbrush.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then wash the thing by hand in warm water or in a washing
                machine in a delicate washing mode.
              </li>

            <h2>Cleaning candleholders from wax</h2>
            <p>
              Cleaning a candle holder from wax is not an easy task. You need to
              choose a method based on the material of the holder itself. Let's
              take a look at the possible options:
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Glass or plastic candle holders</span>
              <br />
              Put the holders in a freezer for 20-30 minutes. Then remove the
              frozen wax with a plastic scraper. To keep the wax from sticking
              to the surface, wipe it off with baby oil before using it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Metal candle holders</span>
              <br />
              You can remove wax from a candlestick by boiling it in water. Put
              the entire item in boiling water and wait for the stains to
              dissolve. Finally, rinse the object with cold water and wipe it
              with a flannel cloth.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Silver candle holders</span>
              <br />
              You must be extremely careful not to damage the holder. Place the
              item in the freezer for 25 minutes and then remove any residue by
              hand. To keep the silver shiny, wipe it with alcohol after
              cleaning.

            <h2>Cleaning tableware from wax</h2>
            <p>
              You can remove wax from dishes (metal, plastic, glass, Teflon)
              with many improvised means.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Scraping and heating</span>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Scrape the wax off the edge with a plastic spatula. Any plastic
                spatula will work.
              </li>
              <li>Remove the bulk of the stain.</li>
              <li>
                If there are large pieces left, carefully scrape them off.
              </li>
              <li>
                Heat the remaining traces with a hot hair dryer and remove them
                with a napkin.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Hot water</span>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Boil a large pot of water and put dirty dishes in it.</li>
              <li>Add liquid soap or dish wash detergent.</li>
              <li>
                Keep on the fire for 10 minutes to boil it more and drain the
                water.
              </li>
              <li>Rinse the dishes in cold water.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Baking Soda</span>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Remove the main part of the wax with a plastic spatula.</li>
              <li>
                Apply baking soda to the sponge and rub the remaining residue.
              </li>
              <li>Wash in cold water with a cleaning detergent.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Hot steam</span>
              <br />
              You can remove the wax from glass and other fragile materials with
              a hot steam jet:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Boil the kettle and put the desired part of the dish under the
                steam flow.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then you need to wipe off the melted wax with paper towels.
              </li>
              <li>Finally, rinse the item in cold water.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Oil</span>
              <br />
              You can clean wax that has built up a thick layer inside a metal
              bowl or pan this way:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Put the stained container on fire and wait until the paraffin
                begins to melt.
              </li>
              <li>Add in vegetable oil and mix thoroughly.</li>
              <li>Use a paper towel to remove the resulting substance.</li>
              <li>Finish by washing the item with a dishwashing detergent.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This method is only suitable for heat-resistant cookware.</p>
