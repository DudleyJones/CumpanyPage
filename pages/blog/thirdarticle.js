              Sofa cleaning – determine the upholstery type!
            </h1>
            <p>
              What material is the upholstery of your sofa? This is the first
              question you will hear on the phone when you call a professional
              dry cleaner. It is the upholstery type which determines the
              possibility of cleaning and the final cost of the service, and
              together with the information about the nature of the dirt it
              determines the guarantee for the result which the professionals
              can give.
            </p>
            <p>
              The easiest way to find out the type of upholstery on your sofa is
              to look for the label. Each item whether it is a sofa, armchair,
              mattress or rugs have a label sewn onto it that describes all the
              materials used to create the item. It is usually located on the
              underside of the couch if you turn it upside down. Sometimes this
              label is attached onto sofa tabs or cushions. If the sofa cushion
              has a zipper, the label may be inside. If you find such a label,
              it will be a good idea to take a picture of it and save it so that
              next time you do not have to flip a heavy sofa. Also, when
              ordering a sofa cleaning service, you can send a picture to the
              cleaning company and they will be able to find the right cleaning
              products for your upholstery in advance.

            <p>
              At the very least, a cleaning technician who comes to your home
              can determine the type of upholstery. There are some types of
              upholstery that cannot be cleaned with steam or water, in which
              case it makes no sense to call a professional cleaner, who will
              only come explaining that cleaning is not possible and leave.
              Unless, of course, you are not faced with the choice of throwing
              out the couch or take a risk and clean it without any guarantees.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you can not find any information on the upholstery of your
              sofa, do not be upset, you can try to determine the type of
              material yourself by comparing with images of fabrics on the
              Internet. There are many varieties of upholstery materials for
              sofas. They differ in composition characteristics. Our article
              will help you determine the material of which your sofa is made
              of, and whether can it be steam-cleaned. You will also find some
              good advice on how to take care of your sofa upholstered with the
              most popular fabrics. Here we go.
            </p>
            <h2>Nonnatural upholstery fabrics</h2>
            <p>
              Nonnatural (artificial and synthetic) fabrics are most often used
              for sofa upholstery. The material of such fabrics is highly
              durable, resistant to abrasion, burnout and easy to steam-clean
              with professional detergents.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using the <span className="span-bold">steam cleaning</span> method,
              any stains, even the oldest stains, can be removed from the
              upholstery of sofas made of artificial and synthetic fabrics.
              However, a guaranteed result can only be achieved if the stain has
              not been washed out with household cleaners.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Attention!</strong> – <span className="span-italic">
                Attempts to remove stains by own household solutions can lead to
                streaks, get rid of which even professionals wouldn't help you!
              </span>
            </p>
            <img

              alt="Natural types of fabric in blue shade"
            />
            <h3>Flock</h3>
            <p>Flock is a material consisting of two parts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Wait until the night time or close the curtains – it should be
                dark in the room. You can turn on lights in adjoining rooms or
                use a regular flashlight.
              </li>
              <li>The base, which is made of cotton, polyester or nylon.</li>
              <li>Pile, usually made of nylon.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The appearance of flock resembles suede – it is soft, pleasant to
              touch and as easy to care for. Flock does not burn out in the sun,
              is resistant to moisture and mechanical damage. Perhaps the only
              notable disadvantage of this material – it absorbs and retains
              odors for a long time. For this reason, sofas with flock
              upholstery are usually not installed in the kitchen or dining
              room.
            </p>
            <p>
              To care for a sofa made of flock is recommended to periodically
              clean its upholstery with a vacuum cleaner, as well as wipe the
              surface with a slightly damp soft cloth or sponge.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/c3.jpg" alt="Flock fabric in different colors" />
            <h3>Chenille</h3>
            <p>
              Because of its properties Chenille is recognized as the optimal
              upholstery fabric: aesthetic appearance high wears resistance and
              easy to maintain. Chenille refers to semi-synthetic (blended)
              fabrics. It is non-toxic and does not cause allergies even to
              children. The disadvantage of this material is its sensitivity to
              the animals claws. They leave snags that remain on the upholstery.
            </p>
            <p>
              For regular maintenance of furniture with chenille upholstery, a
              vacuum cleaner and a slightly damp sponge are sufficient. To
              maintain the cleanliness of the upholstery and the filling of the
              sofa, it is recommended to conduct a deep professional cleaning at
              least twice a year.
            </p>
            <img

              alt="Chenille fabric in different colors"
            />
            <h3>Jacquard</h3>
            <p>
              Jacquard is a very strong and durable material with a smooth,
              lint-free surface. In appearance, it is similar to silk, but the
              performance properties of jacquard are much higher.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jacquard fabrics are quite demanding to care for. To avoid color
              fade, this material should be kept out of direct sunlight.
              Jacquard does not like water – from the abundant moisture on the
              fabric stains easily appear. Therefore, for the care of sofas with
              jacquard upholstery recommended delicate professional
              steam-cleaning. A detergent dissolved in water is sprayed on the
              surface of the sofa, and immediately absorbed by an extractor
              cleaner, leaving the upholstery almost dry. We recommend leaving
              the wet cleaning of jacquard sofas to professionals with extensive
              experience!
            </p>

            <h3>Grain sack fabric</h3>
            <p>
              A grain sack fabric is a loose and porous material with a coarse
              basket-like weave of threads. The grain sack fabric is always in
              the center of attention of pets – it is their favorite place for
              sharpening their claws. Therefore, a house with cats is not the
              best place to install such a sofa.
            </p>
            <p>
              The coarse weave and the large distance between the threads of the
              fabric make the sofa upholstery vulnerable to dust, small debris
              and liquids spilled on the sofa. These can quickly penetrate right
              into the sofa's filling. It is advisable to steam-clean your grain
              sack fabric sofa at least twice a year.
            </p>

              alt="Grain sack fabrics in blue and white colors"
            />
            <h3>Microfiber</h3>
            <p>
              It permeates the air, allows furniture to breathe. The upholstery
              is durable, elegant, does not accumulate static electricity. It is
              made of polyamide, polyester microfibers, which provide high
              strength and elasticity. To prevent abrasion, the surface is
              soaked with Teflon. It does not absorb grease, unpleasant odors,
              repels moisture and dirt. Special cleaning agents are needed to
              remove stains from it.
            </p>

            <h3>Arpatec (artificial leather)</h3>
            <p>
              Synthetic material, resistant to temperature changes, mechanical
              damage. Designed for heavy loads, tear-resistant. Among all
              upholstery materials, Apartek is the most durable. Easy to use, it
              repels moisture, does not burn out in the open sun.

            />
            <h2>Natural upholstery fabrics</h2>
            <p>
              Natural fabrics are environmentally friendly, they are soft and
              pleasant to the touch, have a beautiful texture. But,
              unfortunately, upholstery made of natural materials rather quickly
              rubs off and tears, easily absorbs dirt and unpleasant odors,
              stretches during use and loses brightness of colors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cleaning furniture with such upholstery is quite problematic – it
              does not like the warm treatment, it can deform and give shrinkage
              with abundant moisture. The wrong detergent can discolor the
              upholstery or cause it to tear. Natural fabrics require a gentle
              care in use and in cleaning.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="span-bold">Professional steam-cleaning</span> allows
              a delicate cleaning of difficult to care natural fabrics. The
              exception to this is when the dirt has been mopped up with
              household solutions or when more than 1 week has elapsed since it
              appeared. Under such conditions, even specialists with impressive
              experience cannot give a 100% guarantee of cleanliness.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/c9.jpg" alt="Natural fabrics in biege shades" />
            <h3>Silk</h3>
            <p>
              Silk sofa is a luxury piece of interior. Today it is almost
              impossible to find 100% natural silk upholstery of furniture due
              to its impracticality. Natural silk is a very fragile material; it
              is easy to tear and even the slightest drop of liquid spreads over
              it, forming a large area stain leaving blurriness.
            </p>
            <p>
              To improve the performance of silk and to give it an extra
              durability, modern textile manufacturers add synthetic threads to
              its composition. But even semi-synthetic silk tends to get dirty
              and rub off quickly. Frequent cleaning of such fabrics is not
              recommended.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether it is a luxurious antique couch made of the most expensive
              natural silk of the past centuries or a modern sofa made of
              semi-synthetic silk upholstery – if you clean it yourself, you
              cannot avoid streaks that are impossible to remove. Therefore, we
              recommend not to test your furniture for durability and to clean a
              silk upholstered sofa right away. It is better to call a competent
              specialist first.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Attention! </strong>– <span className="span-italic">
                Silk upholstered furniture should never be cleaned with
                household detergents!
              </span>
            </p>

              alt="Silk fabric in blue and green shades"
            />
            <h3>Velvet</h3>
            <p>
              Velvet and velour upholstery have a soft, wispy surface. Over
              time, the pile on these fabrics crumples or rubs off, losing its
              volume and causing gaps in the upholstery.
            </p>
            <p>
              Never use liquid soaps, solvents or nail polish remover to clean
              velvet and velour upholstery. Often on the Internet you can find
              advice on cleaning velvet upholstery with alcohol. Do not
              experiment! The dye of tufted fabrics is very unstable. As a
              result of the wrong action, you risk wiping the pile off and
              discoloring the upholstery.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Attention! </strong>– <span className="span-italic">
                Sofas with velvet and velour upholstery are recommended for
                professional cleaning only!
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps the only thing you can do by yourself for the benefit of
              your velvet sofa is to vacuum it twice a month and brush it with a
              soft sponge. This will prevent pile formation and preserve the
              pile texture of the upholstery material.
            </p>

            <h3>Suede</h3>
            <p>
              Natural suede is a durable and hard-wearing material. Both natural
              and synthetic suede should not be exposed to excessive moisture.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Attention! </strong>– <span className="span-italic">
                Contrary to popular advice on various web sites, do not rub
                suede with alcohol, nail polish remover or solvents.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              The best way to keep suede upholstered furniture is to vacuum it
              weekly. Change the top sides of your sofa cushions every time you
              clean. This way, the wear and tear on the fabric will be less
              noticeable.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your sofa's suede upholstery has stains or streaks from spilled
              liquids, it's best to contact a professional cleaner right away.
            </p>

            <h3>Cotton and linen</h3>
            <p>
              Cotton and linen are materials of plant origin. They are
              absolutely environmentally friendly and hypoallergenic. But cotton
              and linen fabrics are not durable – they are very crumple and
              subjected to shrinkage. Therefore, manufacturers add synthetics to
              its composition. The result is a more pliable, durable and less
              wrinkled material that is resistant to heat and moisture
              treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              But even blended cotton and linen fabrics easily absorb odors and
              almost irreversibly stain when exposed to the dye pigment from
              food, beverages, ink pens.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Attention! </strong>– <span className="span-italic">
                Attempting to clean cotton or linen upholstery yourself usually
                ends up increasing the stain area – the dirt spreads even
                further across the upholstery. Only professional cleaning is a
                guaranteed way to bring your linen or cotton sofa back to
                cleanliness and eliminate the unpleasant smell.

            <h3>Wool</h3>
            <p>
              Natural wool has been used in weaving for thousands of years. It
              is also often used in the production of upholstery fabrics for
              furniture. More and more often synthetic fibers are added to their
              composition. Thanks to this mixed wool fabrics acquire higher
              parameters of durability and strength. The understanding that the
              sofa is upholstered in wool fabric, gives the product a higher
              status in the eyes of the consumer. However, the woolen upholstery
              needs specific care.
            </p>
            <p>
              The term wool refers to sheep, goat, camel, dog hair, lama –
              natural fibers sheared from domestic animals. Raw materials are
              combed out, cleaned, straightened, washed, spun, bleached, dyed,
              deodorized. The result is a woolen yarn for the production of
              textiles. Wool yarn in the manufacture of upholstery furniture
              fabrics is combined with acrylic, nylon, polyamide. There are
              international designations of wool fibers. When you see them on
              the label of the roll of fabric, you buy or on the label of the
              sofa, you will know that it is wool. Knowing how to care for it,
              you won't make mistakes and ruin your sofa upholstery. Here are
              these designations:
            </p>

              Common properties are hygroscopicity, warmth retention,
              harmonization of body temperature and ambient air. Softness,
              durability, slow wetting compared to natural plant fibers.

              Among the disadvantages you should note: the ability to bunch, or
              to pile up, due to the entanglement of small fibers. The formation
              of lint on the surface (the less twisted the thread, the more lint
              appear.) Shrinkage when washing – (water is not good for wool
              care) and vulnerability to moths.

              Pure wool is almost never used these days. Usually, synthetics
              such as acrylic are added to it. Thanks to such additives, wool
              fabrics gain new properties. Another argument for blended fabrics
              is the low cost compared to pure wool analogues.

              natural fabrics yourself, we give some professional advice that
              will help you avoid irreversible damage to the sofa.

                Before using any detergent, be sure to test its action on a
                little-noticeable area of furniture.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do not rub the detergent or stain remover onto the surface of
                the sofa! After applying the solution to the upholstery, use a
                household vacuum cleaner with a furniture nozzle.

                When removing a fresh stain, blot it with a cloth, moving from
                the edge of the stain to the center.

              Natural fabrics are a difficult material to care for. It is not
              always possible to say for sure whether a sofa with some kind of
              upholstery can be wet-cleaned or not. The task of a specialist is
              not just to clean but not to harm the sofa.&nbsp;
              <span className="span-bold">The Couch-Cleaning</span> masters treat
              the results of their work with great responsibility. Therefore, if
              in your case water cleaning is ineffective or strongly
              contraindicated, the specialist will tell you that wet-cleaning is
              not recommended.

              If you are in doubt about which category, your upholstery belongs
              to, do not take any steps to clean it yourself! Contact&nbsp;
